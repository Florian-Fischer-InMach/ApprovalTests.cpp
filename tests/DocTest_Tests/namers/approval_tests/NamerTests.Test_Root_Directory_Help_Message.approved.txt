* Hello from Approval Tests.
*
* It looks like your compiler does not define __BASE_FILE__, and
* your program is calling some code that requires knowledge of
* the location of the main() in your source tree.
*
* The workaround for this is to add the following to
* your main.cpp file:
*
*     APPROVAL_TESTS_REGISTER_MAIN_DIRECTORY
*
* Currently, this is only required if you are using TemplatedCustomNamer's
* {RelativeTestSourceDirectory}.
*                                                                           *
